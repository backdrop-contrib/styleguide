Style Guide
===========

This module makes a single page on which all common Backdrop elements are
displayed, such as all message styles, progress bars, form elements, tabs,
etc. It allows a themer to have a reference for all these elements at once,
rather than needing to find a place where each element is used independently.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules
